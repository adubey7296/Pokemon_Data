Let us see how to be performing Pokémon data analysis.

## Big Data, Contributed to Pokémon Go... 

Pokémon Go, the world’s first real world gaming, hit mobile devices on July 7. It has taken the world by storm, catapulting augmented reality technology into the mainstream. It is time to start thinking about how AR could change our streets forever?

The free mobile game already has almost as many active users as Twitter, despite being launched just 20 days ago, and added more users its first day than dating app Tinder has in total. The unanticipated success of the game- which so far has only been made available in a handful of countries- has driven co-owner Nintendo’s share price up by almost 50 per cent, adding over $10 billion to the gaming company’s value.

## What is Pokémon Go?

Pokemon Go, as you know, is a location based, multiplayer, augmented reality game in which you can interact with virtual objects in your physical surroundings using your smart phone. You play the game by navigating through your physical location and keep a watch on the Pokemons located around you.

If you see a Pokemon, you will throw your Pokeball to catch it (all digitally). The Pokemon you catch will be added to your collection. You will also see a map around which you will be navigating inside the game.

These maps will show you feature like Pokeshops and Pokegyms which are located at public places like parks, art installations, museums, historical places etc. You will keep collecting the virtual Pokemons from all these places and continue playing it like a typical Pokemon game.

## How is Big Data used for Pokémon Go?

Pokemon Go through its location based feature identifies your location using your phone’s GPS, and tailors the Pokemon based on these locations. Like if the location is a water body, it will show you water based Pokemon (PokeWater). First it’ll recognize the place through your GPS and then show the Pokemons as per the context.

This means the game has lots of information about the locations where you are playing this game. And what’s that large set of information which the game has about you and your location? They are the large datasets which we often refer to as Big Data.

So what you are playing is the Google map with augmented reality driven by Big Data which is giving you the impression of co-presence of the virtual Pokemons in your physical surroundings.
